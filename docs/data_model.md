# Data model

All shapes are declared as LuaCATS types so data files are statically checked. The canonical
declarations live next to their data; this file is the human-readable overview.

## Implemented

### PlayerData (`data/players.lua`)

```lua
---@alias Position "keeper"|"defender"|"midfielder"|"forward"

---@class StatBlock
---@field pace integer       -- movement speed, acceleration, sprint expression
---@field strength integer   -- shot speed and physical duels
---@field technique integer  -- passing, ball control, and aerial reception
---@field stamina integer    -- sprint-tank capacity and recovery
---@field mental integer     -- positioning, composure, and keeper reading

---@class PlayerData
---@field id string          -- stable unique key
---@field name string
---@field number integer
---@field position Position
---@field stats StatBlock
---@field presentation_id string
---@field cosmetic_variant_id string?
---@field loadout_id string? -- nil for protected keepers
```

Galactic Cup's `planet`, neutral mechanical `species`,
`presentation_species`, and reserved `trait` values live in
`data/showcase_player_compatibility.lua`. That explicit compatibility table
keeps the shipped showcase presentation and simulation seam intact without
making its theme fields part of persistent GOLISEO player identity.

### Derived quantities (`sim/stats.lua`)

- `move_speed(stats)` = `BASE_MOVE + pace * MOVE_PER_PACE` (px/s)
- `shot_speed(stats)` = `BASE_SHOT + strength * SHOT_PER_STRENGTH` (px/s)
- `keeper_reach(stats)` derives defensive reach from `mental` + `pace`; defensive
  ability is not a sixth authored attribute.

These formulas bridge manager-facing stats to pitch behavior. Tune constants here.

### TeamData (`data/teams.lua`)

`id, name, color {r,g,b}, formation` (key into formations), `roster` (5 player ids,
exactly one keeper; the other 4 in formation line order defence→attack).

### FormationData (`data/formations.lua`)

`id, name, keeper Anchor, outfield OutfieldAnchor[4]`. An `Anchor` is normalized
`{x, y}` in an attacking-right frame; each outfield anchor also owns the stable
`def`, `mid`, `wide`, or `fwd` role used by off-ball run eligibility.
`sim/placement.lua` converts anchors to absolute coords and mirrors for away.

### MatchPlayer / MatchState / MatchInput (`sim/match.lua`)

The full pure 5v5 simulation: per-player runtime entity, the whole match state (players, ball,
owner, score, timer), and per-step input. See the `---@class` annotations in the file.

### CombatMatchState (`sim/combat.lua`)

Combat is an explicit fixed-tick opt-in carried beside, rather than hidden
inside, the existing soccer state. `CombatMatchState` owns one runtime per
stable match-player index, deterministic projectile state, a monotonic action
sequence, and typed combat events. Each player runtime records only its
mechanical family, action phase/ticks, cooldown, contact guard, forced
stagger/knockback, the 30-tick chain cap, and recovery immunity.

`match.step` accepts this companion as an optional fourth argument. Omitting it
preserves the existing `MatchState`, `MatchPlayer`, `MatchEvent`, and
soccer-only snapshot/hash contract exactly. Keepers and players without a
loadout receive a neutral combat runtime and ignore equipment intent.

Presentation, cosmetic, theme, and equipment-appearance ids never enter the
companion. `data/action_families.lua` remains the sole tuning authority.
Combat-active snapshot/hash/rollback integration uses match snapshot version 13,
combat snapshot version 3, and input tape version 2. A combat-enabled match
must supply the companion at capture; passing only the soccer half fails
loudly.

Kickoff resets clear action, forced-state, and projectile runtime, but preserve
the scoring tick's event batch and the match-lifetime action sequence. The next
tick's normal event clear still bounds presentation events to one simulation
tick without reusing confirmation identity.

Forced players are ineligible for loose-ball collection and aerial candidate
selection. Their pending soccer commitments are cleared on impact and sanitized
again after ball actions, so a same-tick pass cannot re-arm a staggered receiver.

Phase counters use inclusive fixed-tick windows: a six-tick wind-up committed
on tick 0 is active first on tick 6. Melee reach is measured from the source
center to the target collision circle and ties use forward projection then
stable player index. Ranged actions use swept point-projectile contact at the
catalog's 300 px/s (5 px per fixed tick) for exactly 60 travel ticks. The
initial forced-state presentation threshold classifies displacement below
12 px as stagger and 12 px or more as knockback; either state still obeys the
same 30-tick chain cap and 45-tick immunity floor.

The versioned combat metric dictionary, current-field inventory, and explicit
ownership for missing intent, lifecycle, AI-reason, and soccer-attribution
telemetry live in
[`docs/design/combat_fun_evidence_contract.md`](design/combat_fun_evidence_contract.md).
Research-session and participant data stay outside simulation and replay
identity.

### TacticData (`data/tactics.lua`)

`id, name, press` (how many off-ball players hunt the ball), `line_shift` (anchor depth
bias along the attack axis, fraction of pitch), `stamina_drain` (a currently unused,
post-showcase multiplier), `marking` (off-ball scheme and shape knobs), `transition`
(seconds of counter-press for the team that loses the ball and counter-attack for the team
that wins it).
Applied in `sim/match.lua`: `line_shift` adjusts outfield anchors at build time, `press`
sets `MatchState.press` which drives how many players chase per team, and `transition`
sets `MatchState.transition_windows`, which `sim/possession_transition.lua` decays through
`brain.phase` into each team's counterpress/counterattack phase. Adding a tactic stays a
data edit: a new window pair requires no `sim/` change.

### Widget / Layout (`game/ui/hit.lua`)

A `Layout` is an ordered `Widget[]` (`id, rect, kind, text, selected, data`). Pure screen defs
(`game/screens/squad|formation|tactic.lua`) build a Layout from state; `game/ui/draw.lua`
renders it; `hit.at`/`hit.find` do pure hit-testing. See AGENTS.md §9.

## GOLISEO identity and content separation

`PlayerData` owns persistent identity and authored match attributes without
coupling them to a specific model or item appearance:

```text
PlayerData
    stable identity, name, number, position, stats, loadout
        |
        +-- presentation_id --> reusable character mesh/material/rig package
        |
        +-- cosmetic variant --> palette, head/face, safe accessory choices
```

Ten persistent players may therefore reference six reusable presentation
packages while retaining different names, positions, stats, and loadouts.
Presentation choice never grants stats or a theme passive.

The reusable tables are:

- `data/character_presentations.lua` — six semantic character/rig packages;
- `data/cosmetic_variants.lua` — material, head, and safe-accessory ids;
- `data/equipment_presentations.lua` — six item appearances mapped to family ids;
- `data/action_families.lua` — the four shared mechanical tuning records;
- `data/loadouts.lua` — fixed family/equipment pairs; and
- `sim/content_validation.lua` — pure programmer-error validation for catalogs
  and the default one-of-each fixture.

Tournament Sword, Vector Blade, and Foam Champion all resolve through the same
`light_melee` table. Equipment and character presentation records contain no
stats or copied action tuning.

The first combat and rendering proofs use the existing authored player ids and
stats. A later roster generator may create them from a deterministic seed, but it must
materialize and persist the resolved values. Stats, names, or cosmetics do not
reroll per match or per load. Generated stat profiles use bounded budgets and
position-weighted archetypes rather than five independent random values.

The prototype content contract and randomness guardrails live in
`docs/design/prototype_theme_roster.md`. Runtime combat state, content identity
in snapshots/replays, and asset loading remain downstream work.

## Parked after the showcase

- `data/traits.lua` — `TraitData` (id, name, trigger, effect)
- RPG fields layered onto a runtime `PlayerState` (xp, level, morale, fatigue) — kept separate
  from immutable `PlayerData`.
- Deterministic generated-roster materialization.

These shapes are not part of the active showcase scope. See `docs/showcase_release.md`.
